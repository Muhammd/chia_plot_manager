# Simple python script that helps to move my chia plots from my plotter to
# my nas. I wanted to use netcat as it was much faster on my 10GBe link than
# rsync and the servers are secure so I wrote this script to manage that
# move process.

# This is part of a two part process. On the NAS server there is drive_manager.py
# that manages the drives themselves and decides based on various criteria where
# the incoming plots will be placed. This script simply sends those plots when
# they are ready to send.

#   Updates
#
#   V0.5 2021-04-13
#   - Altered process_plot() and process_control() to integrate network
#     activity monitoring so we do not simply rely on the checkfile. This
#     now requites that Glances be installed and in API mode. We call the
#     Glances API and verify if we have network traffic on the link to the
#     NAS. If we have traffic and the checkfile exists then we know that a 
#     transfer is in progress. If we do not have any network transfer activity
#     we assume there is no transfer and we attempt a reset by removing the
#     checkfile and calling main(). As part of this update we also added 
#     a couple of functions to try and determine if Glances is running and if
#     is not, throw an error and exit. 
#
#   V0.4 2021-04-13 (bumped version to match drive_manager.py
#   - Due to issue with plot size detection happening after plot selection
#     caused an issue where plots did not get moved at all if the first selected
#     plot was the wrong size. Updated get_list_of_plots() to use pathlib to check
#     for proper filesize before passing along the plot name.
#
#   V0.2 2021-03-23
#   - Added per_plot system notification function (send_new_plot_notification()
#     in chianas drive_manager.py and updated process_plot() and verify_plot_move()
#     to support the new function
#   - Moved remote_mount lookup to happen before starting the plot move
